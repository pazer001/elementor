#### Installation
* npm install in both front (Not really necessary) and server folders.
* import the db schemes to a mysql 8 server.
* cd server && node index.js
* enter "http://localhost:5000"

#### Notes
1. I tried to use the new official node mysql 8 connector.
2. Since you asked no compilation in the frontend, I didn't user environment variables.
